My Medieval Avatar is an Object-Oriented Programming Final Project created by Ethan Forsha and Juan Soto in 2022. The application was made to emulate a character creator 
for a Medieval Adventure game and setup the gear system for a future video game implementation. The software was designed using an interface that was used to act as a basis
for all gear items in the game, and in the current version there are 3 different types of gear that a character can have equipped, Head, Chest, and Legs. It also uses a 
Character class that loads all the gear available for the custom avatar, which is extended by a CharacterPane class that loads the character customization screen and buttons. 
The MainMenu class acts as an introduction to the application, and allows the user to choose to play (start customization) or exit the application.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Unfortunately there is no way to locally save custom avatars when the application is closed.
- Only 2 background images available for preview.
